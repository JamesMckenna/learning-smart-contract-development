# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

yarn hardhat node
yarn hardhat run scripts/fund.js --network localhost
yarn hardhat test --network goerli
yarn hardhat deploy --network goerli
